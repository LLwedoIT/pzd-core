PZDetector™ (software engine) manages the Presence Zone™ (proprietary presence boundary standard)—the professional HPD reference standard for defining and managing the spatial relationship between human proximity and system vitality.

Chair‑to‑Keyboard™ builds the PZDetector™ engine — the professional HPD reference standard for defining and managing the Presence Zone™ (PZ).

## The Philosophy

Traditional idle timers are binary and rigid. PZDetector™ introduces Presence Confidence, a state-based approach that understands that "presence" isn't just about moving a mouse. Whether you are petting a cat, taking a call, or deep in thought, PZDetector™ maintains system vitality.

## Key Innovations

**Presence Zone™ (PZ):** The proprietary presence boundary standard defining the spatial perimeter where the user is considered active.

**Glazed Vision (Fog Mode):** A privacy-first HPD method. Instead of high-definition video, PZDetector™ uses low-power, blurred "blob" detection to verify occupancy without capturing biometric data.

The Kitten Buffer (Confidence Decay): A configurable safety net that smoothly transitions from "Occupied" to "Empty." It provides the grace period needed for real-life interruptions.

Sine-Wave Signaling: Non-intrusive hardware feedback. The camera LED "breathes" using a sine-wave pattern to signal that the Zone is secured, rather than flashing or staying static.

**Zero-Signal Architecture:** PZDetector™ explicitly avoids Bluetooth and other high-risk wireless protocols, making it suitable for high-security environments.

## Coining the Presence Zone™

The **Presence Zone™ (PZ)** is more than an idle timer; it is a proprietary spatial boundary standard. Chair-to-Keyboard™ is establishing this term to move the industry away from "inactivity" and toward "spatial awareness."


## Technical Architecture

PZDetector™ is built to align with native OS power management kernels:

Windows: Utilizes SetThreadExecutionState and Windows 11 Presence Sensing APIs.

macOS: Utilizes IOPMAssertionCreateWithDescription and caffeinate inhibitors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.14+
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Hardware: Standard Webcam (for Glazed Vision) or HPD-capable sensor

### Installation

```bash
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/LLwedoIT/pzd-core
Install dependencies: pip install -r app/requirements.txt
Run: python app/main.py
```

## Security & Privacy

PZDetector™ is local-first. No images are ever saved, uploaded, or processed beyond the local "Glazed" state check. It is designed to be invisible to both the user and the network.
